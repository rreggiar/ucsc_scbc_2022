## Prediction:

What does data look like? Where do we keep it?

## Computers and Data

The **command line** gives us an opportunity to work with computers in a more direct way compared to "Folders" and "Files".

## For example:

Look at your desktop, what's there?

Folders?

What's inside?

## This sounds like something we could see in everyday life...

## Computers, on the other hand, think differently

Really they operate in binary, on 1's and 0's, but just beneath 'Files' and 'Folders' they operate with:

"Folders" == "Directories"

"Files" == "Paths"

## **Prediction:**

How will your experience be different when you switch from "human think" to "command line/computer think"?

## Practice 01:

### Create a "Project Folder"

Using the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** provided on your Jupyter login, create a **Folder** called:

`SCBC_2022_folder`

## Practice 01A:

### Create sub-folders and a `README.txt` file:

`data/`

`notes/`

`code/`

## Practice 01B:

### Go back to Jupyter and edit README.txt to say something....

## Reflect:

### What you've just made is a 'project folder':

Why is this useful? What could it help with moving forward?

## So why even bother with the command line? We just did so much!

We can **create, copy, rename, move (etc etc)** files using a GUI, it works, its easy and intuitive.

However, the things you did are

-   only possible if a GUI is provided

-   not **reproducible** (could someone else get the same result? yes...but in the same exact way? maybe not.)

-   **limited** to what the GUI/Operating System designers decided was useful for most users.

Bioinformatics asks us to do much more with data, and thus computers, than most.

## Beyond the GUI: Command Line interface \[CLI\]

On your desktops you can **view** the command line with a **terminal** -- a piece of software built to enable our use of command line programming

## Prediction:

Instead of the mouse, how will we navigate the command line?

## Practice 02: Doing the same stuff differently

### Create a "Project Directory"

```{r}
# dummy R chunk to keep things working
```

```{bash echo=TRUE}
ls
```

```{bash echo=TRUE}
ls SCBC_22
```

```{bash echo=TRUE}
touch SCBC_22/my_file.txt
```

```{bash echo=TRUE}
ls SCBC_22
```
