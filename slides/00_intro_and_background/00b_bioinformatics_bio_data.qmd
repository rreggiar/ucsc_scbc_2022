## What is *Data*, where is *Data*, what does *Data* tell us?

Welcome to the UCSC Genomics Institute Summer Short Course in **Bioinformatics** and **Coding**

The questions at the top of this slide underlie the principles of Bioinformatics, let's keep them in mind throughout the course.

## What is *Data*

What examples of data can you think of?

Here's one example:

```{r}
head(iris)
```

What are the `rows`? What are the `columns`?

## Where is *Data*

Who has it? Any companies out there you like or dislike having your data?

## What about your biological data, anyone in that business?

![if this is YOU...they have bits of YOU as...data](00b_bioinformatics_bio_data_files/images/23andme_ancestry_kit.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Its usually *hosted* on *servers*

![which look something like this...](00b_bioinformatics_bio_data_files/images/14440633_10103136675873201_6012411229515107747_n.0.0.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Why servers?

Remote access allows teams of people to work with *data* to produce *reproducible* results

![a persistent element of Bioinformatics is interfacing with large data sets and the servers that store them -- we can't always use a normal computer setup to achieve this so we're going to learn how else we can.](00b_bioinformatics_bio_data_files/images/what-is-remote-access-for-1024x536.png)

## What does *Data* tell us?

Well it depends on where its coming from...

-   Weather/Climate

-   Social Media

-   Dr's Office

-   Bioinformatics

## How do we generate *Data*?

We take **measurements --** of some kind

-   Weather/Climate

-   Social Media

-   Dr's Office

-   Bioinformatics

## Biology: A source of data, wonder, and ... confusion

With new tools, better understanding, and tons of new scientists we are in the midst of a golden age of biological science.

Unfortunately, Biology is **complicated**.

Your body is made up of *trillions* of cells, all of which have special jobs, some of which are functionally immortal, some of which can contribute to cancerous tumors. Figuring out all of this is going to take a long time, and that's only Humans...

why measure ants?

## How we *measure* Biology: Physical Data

The science of Human throwing -- Data!

## How we *measure* Biology: Epidemiological Data

## How we *measure* Biology: Molecular Data

Molecules are the underlying agents of all the behavior, physical prowess, and disease spread measured above.

One problem: they're really small.

When things become too small to see, we need really powerful technology.

First, some quick background.

## DNA

***D**eoxyribo**N**ucleic**A**cid*

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](00b_bioinformatics_bio_data_files/images/Stockphoto-DNA-Simple2.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
The four 'bases' that make up DNA are the fundamental unit of biological information -- they encode for all the **genes** you inherit. They are studied by chemists, physicists, biologists, and **bioinformaticicans.**

## RNA

***R**ibo**N**ucleic**A**cid*

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![image: Khan Academy](00b_bioinformatics_bio_data_files/images/overview-of-transcription.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
RNA is produced by special cellular machinery based on the content of DNA. If DNA is the blueprint, RNA is the messenger that carries out those instructions (with a little help).

## Protein and the "Central Dogma"

*DNA* --\> *RNA* ---(mostly)---\> *Protein*

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![image: Khan Academy](00b_bioinformatics_bio_data_files/images/20ce29384b2e7ff0cdea72acaa5b1dbd7287ab00.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Protein is the final product of DNA and RNA (most of the time...) and helps form all of the major organs (including skin, hair, nails) that form our physical being.
:::
:::

## What types of biological measurements can we take?

Protein is cool and commonly studied with bioinformatics approaches, but we'll focus on:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**DNA: What's there?**

-   What genes does someone have?

-   Do their genes have the expected 'bases'? Or do they have mutations?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**RNA: How is it behaving?**

-   How much of a given gene is being produced?

-   Are there any changes to how the gene is processed?

## Next Generation Sequencing: Putting *info* in *bioinformatics*

A technological revolution that will shape the rest of our lives (and its already doing a whole lot of shaping).

How do we **measure** DNA and RNA? Almost in the same way we follow ants around.....

We **sequence** the molecules: The bases `A`,`C`,`T`/`U`, & `G` form sequences/patterns/'words' of `data` that we can read from the RNA/DNA molecules

Let's watch (parts) of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8)

## What can Bioinformatics help us accomplish with Sequencing Data?

Once we measure DNA/RNA molecules with sequencing, we have **tons of data** that looks something like this:

```{r}
cat('>GENE_ABC|protein_coding\nCCCAGATCTCTTCAGTTTTTATGCCTCATTCTGT')
```

The human genome has 3 **billion** bases, meaning we get a lot of DNA sequence to work with.

## Basic Discovery: Sequence of the Novel Coronavirus

Before vaccines, before treatments, before we could fight SARS-CoV-2, we needed to sequence its genome, identify the genes within, and they proteins they encode for.

![Andersen, K.G., Rambaut, A., Lipkin, W.I. et al. The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2. Nat Med 26, 450--452 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9](00b_bioinformatics_bio_data_files/images/41591_2020_820_Fig1_HTML.webp)

## Engineering new tools: Genome editing

If we're going to edit the genome, we need to know what's there already AND if our edit worked!

```{r}
cat('>GENE_ABC|protein_coding_no-edit\nCCCAGATCTCTTCAGTTTTTATGCCTCATTCTGT')
cat('>GENE_ABC|protein_coding_three-edit\nCCCAGATCTCTTCATTTTTTATGCCCCATTCTAT')
```

## Clinical approaches: Cell-free DNA Liquid Biopsies

Sequence DNA/RNA in the blood, find tumors without scans/surgery
