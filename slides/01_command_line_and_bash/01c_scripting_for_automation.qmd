## Scenario: Automating molecular diagnosis

Yep, you're still a **Bioinformatician** working for a molecular diagnostics lab

-   The only thing is, you need to start thinking about doing these kind of analyses again and again and again and again ......

-   The lab says they might send 100's if not 1000's of samples through your approach

## Job #3: Automate your approaches in a Bash script

But first.....what's a script?

## Kinda like a tool but you make it yourself

Really, its any assembly of code to accomplish a task or multiple tasks.

-   When you combine a bunch of tools that already exist, you might call it a `pipeline`

-   Similar to the `pipe` we just learned about, this means outputs flowing into inputs for the next set of commands
