## Reflecting on what we've already done

The file you worked with in [01a](https://rreggiar.github.io/ucsc_scbc_2022/slides/01_command_line_and_bash/01a_file_explorer_to_cmdline.html#/title-slide), `talking.txt` , is in `FASTA` format.

```{bash, echo=TRUE}
head -4 ../../data/talking.txt
```

What are some things we could do with/to `FASTA` files?

## FASTA files == sequence `data`
